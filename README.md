## Summary
Determining long and short term users, usage by gender, and peak hours has provided a better picture of the demographic using the bike-sharing program. This provides key information for strategic marketing to the right demographics.  The trip duration and top bike start and end locations provide insight that top stations are located in most densely populated areas, and majority of trips are a 30 min bike ride (~ 5 miles) or less.  This is the real crux of the bike sharing program to be successful, do the people of Des Moines have similar commutes of short distances. The comparative analysis with the geographical nature of Des Moines would be needed as well as further analysis a few key areas, specifically weather, traffic, and parking.
